# fractall

A fractal renderer/explorer progressively being improved and iterated upon.

Planned features:
- Graphical, real-time interactive user interface (using SDL2/SFML)
- Allow custom functions to be used to generate fractals
- Allow exploration via zooming and panning controls
- Utilize multithreading
- Tile-based rendering based on scale increments
- Render queues and caching for tiles

Future ideas:
- GPU parallellization using CUDA/OpenCL
- Custom image format to save/load data
